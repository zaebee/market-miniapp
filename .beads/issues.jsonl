{"id":"market-miniapp-9a9","title":"[Context] Vibe Kanban Web Companion Integration","description":"# Vibe Kanban Web Companion Integration\n\n## What It Is\nThe Vibe Kanban Web Companion is a React component that provides real-time project tracking and task management capabilities within the Strapi admin panel.\n\n## Integration Details\n\n### Package\n- **Name**: `vibe-kanban-web-companion`\n- **Version**: `^0.0.5`\n- **Package Manager**: Bun (primary), npm (fallback)\n\n### Key Files\n- `src/admin/app.tsx` - Strapi admin customization entry point\n- `package.json` - Dependency declaration\n- `bun.lock` - Lockfile for Bun package manager\n\n### Implementation\nLocated in `src/admin/app.tsx`:\n```tsx\nimport type { StrapiApp } from '@strapi/strapi/admin';\nimport { VibeKanbanWebCompanion } from 'vibe-kanban-web-companion';\n\nexport default {\n  bootstrap(app: StrapiApp) {\n    // IMPORTANT: Must return JSX element, not component type\n    app.registerHook('Admin/Root', () =\u003e \u003cVibeKanbanWebCompanion /\u003e);\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Architecture Notes\n- **Framework**: Strapi 5.33.2 (headless CMS)\n- **Hook**: Uses Strapi's `Admin/Root` hook to inject at app root\n- **Rendering**: Client-side only (Strapi admin is CSR, no SSR concerns)\n- **Integration Point**: Renders at the highest level of admin UI hierarchy\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Updating the Component\n```bash\nbun update vibe-kanban-web-companion\nnpm run build  # Verify Strapi build\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n1. **Component not appearing**: Ensure JSX syntax `() =\u003e \u003cComponent /\u003e` not `() =\u003e Component`\n2. **Build failures**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check TypeScript errors\n3. **Hook errors**: Check Strapi version compatibility with `Admin/Root` hook\n\n### Verification Commands\n```bash\nnpx tsc --noEmit           # Type-check\nnpm run build              # Build Strapi admin\nnpm run dev                # Start development server\n```\n\n## Related PRs\n- #6: Initial integration and reviewer feedback fix\n\n## Future Work\n- Monitor for companion updates\n- Consider additional hooks if more integration points needed\n- Track usage patterns and user feedback","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T22:14:46.604410879+03:00","created_by":"zaebee","updated_at":"2026-01-10T22:15:06.502110829+03:00","labels":["context","documentation","vibe-kanban"]}
